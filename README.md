# Task-1
General code for solving beam structures from finite element method point of view

With this repository I'm going to be able to develop some programming skills in order to develop cleaner and more organized codes.

This new updates should appear on the new created brach "example branch". I am going to typesome comments in different files in order to observe these changes on this new branch.

First-class will be another example of branch in order to understand how classes are created and their environment.
